The bicyles used are <b>fixed gear bicycles</b>, with handlebars that can spin 360 degrees. The field in which competitions are conducted should have wooden surface, and dimensions that range from <b>9 x 12m to 11 x 14m</b>. For international competitions, the maximum size fields are required. The rectangular court should have <b>three concentric circles 0.5, 4, and 8m diameters</b>.<br><br>Artistic cycling routines can be performed in singles, in pairs, or four or six member teams. Each routine lasts for <b>five minutes</b> and riders perform as many moves as possible within the allocated time. Competitions are conducted in a format similar to that of gymnastics in which each routine performed is judged by a panel of judges. Each routine is scored based on several factors, like degree of difficulty of the moves performed and execution, and are awarded points.<br><br>Teams are also deducted points for failure to complete certain moves. The individual or team with the most number of points at the end wins the competition. The highest level competition conducted for the sport is at the UCI Indoor Cycling World Championships.</td></tr>

Individual Pursuit races range from <b>1000m to 4000m</b>. Riders begin the individual pursuit on opposite side of the track from a stationary start and race against the clock to ride the distance as fast as possible. In older age groups, these races are completed with <b>time trial bars</b> attached to the bike.<br><br>It is a relatively short endurance track cycling event that pits riders against both the clock and each other. The competition begins with a <b>4-kilometer (16-lap) qualifying round</b>. The fastest eight riders advance to the first round and are seeded accordingly as the number-one seed is matched against the number-eight seed, the number-two seed is paired against the number-seven seed, and so on.<br><br>In round one, riders start on opposite sides of the track and pursue each other over a distance of four kilometers. The two winners with the fastest times advance to the gold-medal final, while the other two winners advance to the bronze-medal final.

Riders perform <b>8 laps of the 250m track</b> initially following the motor-pacer, typically a small motorbike or electronic bike, that starts slowly (approximately <b>25kph</b>) and gradually increases in speed (approximately <b>50kph</b>) while riders line-up behind, ready to attack when they are released.<br><br>Riders cannot attack over the top of the motor-pacer and have to wait until it exits the track, which will happen with <b>700m</b> to go. Strong riders on the final lap of a Keirin can reach speeds in excess of <b>70kph</b> approaching the finish line.<br><br>Six riders start behind a derny, or motorized pacing bicycle, and jockey for position. They ride behind the derny at increasing speed for five laps (at the Olympics, this varies at other velodromes). After five laps, the derny pulls off and the riders race the last two laps. This is perhaps the fastest race in track cycling with speeds well over 70kph.</td></tr>

A relay of sorts, it is raced in teams of two inside a mass field. The aim of the game is to take <b>maximum points on a sprint lap</b>, which are held every <b>20 laps</b> or gain a lap by attacking. Only one rider in a pair is racing at any given time so the other rider circles the track at the top of the banking waiting for their moment to <b>'tag in'</b>. The handover isn't with a baton, instead, riders indicate the switch over with a <b>hand-sling</b>, propelling their teammate into the race. This usually happends to set up a <b>sprint or attack</b>. It is one of the most complex but gripping races of the schedule so be sure to tune in.<br><br>Essentialy, it's a longer version of the points race, competed in pairs. Two-man teams contest the mass-start event, which is typically <b>50-60 km</b>. (A <b>20 km</b> women's Madison has been introduced for the 2016-17 season.) The best Madison teams will have one rider with <b>great endurance</b>, capable of a long push to take a lap, and one who specializes in <b>sprinting</b> and can take sprint points or make a sudden explosive effort to make a break.<br><br>The Madison is a feature of <b>six-day races</b>, but it can also be a separate race, such as at <b>World Cups</b> and the <b>World Championships</b>.

Primes are a great way for riders to get a little extra in their pockets. Sometimes riders can make more money collecting primes then winning the race. The primes are <b>spectator primes</b> meaning the more fans we have the more money we will payout in primes to the riders. Spectators can also make a donation to the <b>"Prime Fund"</b> in which they can pick the lap and race they want to have the prime.
